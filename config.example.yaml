commonVarDict:
  var1: "value1" # varObject can be a string, which is intuitive
  var2:
    value: "value2" # varObject can be {"value": "a string"}, fixing its value
  var3:
    defaultValue: "value3" # varObject can be {"defaultValue": "a string"}. When this type of var is being resolved, myinit will ask the user for its value. The user can hit return key to use the default Value.
  var4: {} # varObject can be {}. When this type of var is being resolved, myinit will ask the user for its value.
  var5:
    refVar: var1 # varObject can be {"refVar": "anotherVarName"} referenced a variable. Note: every var reference is looked up again from the very context of the start of variable resolving (e.g. in an entry, every refVar is resolved by first looking at its varDict, no matter where the currently referencing varObject is)
  var6: "{var3} wow wow" # varObject can be a string which in python3 uses a string formatter. In this case the referenced variables will be resolved in the same way as refVar.
  var7: # its final value will be "{var4} <- do not resolve this!" itself
    value: "{var4} <- do not resolve this!"
